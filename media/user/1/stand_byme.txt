[Verse]

G                        Em
When the night has come and the land is dark

        C             D              G
and the moon is the only light we'll see

G                         Em             
no I won't be afraid oh I won't be afraid

         C           D             G
just as long as you stand stand by me


[Chorus]

G                                 Em
So darling darling stand by me oh stand by me

   C              D           G
oh stand stand by me stand by me



If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry I won't cry no I won't shed a tear
just as long as you stand stand by me

And darling darling stand by me oh stand by me
oh stand now stand by me stand by me

So Darling darling stand by me oh stand by me
oh stand now stand by me stand by me
whenever you're in trouble would you
stand by me oh stand by me
oh would stand now oh stand stand by me
