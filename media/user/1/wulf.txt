Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood
D
You sure are lookin' good
F                   E7                 Am
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Am                    C
Little Red Riding Hood
D
I don't think little big girls should
F                    E7              Am
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

C
 What big eyes you have
Am
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
   D
So just to see that you don't get chased
             G7
I think I    ought to walk with you for a ways
C
What fool lips you have
  Am
They're sure to lure someone bad
D
So until you get to Grandma's place
                G7
I think you    ought to walk with me and be safe

Am                          C
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
D
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
F                     E7               Am
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone
Am                    C
Little Red Riding Hood,
D
I'd like to hold you if I could
F                         E7                Am
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't

C
What a big heart I have
Am
The better to love you with
D
Little Red Riding Hood
     G7                 
Even bad wolves can be good
C
I'll try to keep satisfied
Am
Just to walk close by your side
D
Maybe you'll see things my way
      G7                   
Before we get to Grandma's place

Am                    C
