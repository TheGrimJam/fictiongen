Signs of discomfort:

- Neck Touching / Neck Rubbing. When rubbed, the front or back of the neck will lower the heart rate and c omfort.

- Face touching/rubbing. Eyes, hair, lips, or exhaling hair.

- Leg rubbers.

- Withdrawing or Blocking: If someone becomes uncomfortable with the person or conversation, they will gain distance or place blockades between the person. Coldness, and comfort are relevant here.

- Feet pointing; if feet are pointed away it would suggest they want an exit. Towards, and they're probably comfortable.

- Little eye contact; fuck noticing this.

- Touching of the nose; nose becomes itchy due to capillary narrowing in moments of negativity or stress. People want to touch it. Touch the nose. Touch. Touch.



self:

A head held still appears confident. Particularly use when staring, which can equalize the field a bit. Some rambling about certainty being involved here, but that comes mired with it's own pitfalls of attention.


Question: 

Does practice out of place still function via general intuitive memory for solving problems elsewhere? Inclined to yes.
